Step,Technology,Key_Implementation_Details
1. Initialize Project,Flask + React + PostgreSQL + Docker,"Select proven, scalable technologies with good community support"
1.1 Select Tech Stack,"Python Flask, React.js, PostgreSQL, Docker","Flask for lightweight API, React for modern UI, PostgreSQL for reliability"
1.2 Create Project Folders,Backend/ Frontend/ Database/ Docs/,"Separate concerns: /backend, /frontend, /database, /docs directories"
1.3 Set Up Version Control,Git repository initialization,"Initialize git, create .gitignore, set up branching strategy"
2. Design Database,PostgreSQL with proper normalization,Design normalized database schema with proper indexing
2.1 Define Tables,"Products, Orders, Users, Invoices, Order_Items","Core entities: Products, Orders, Users, Invoices, Order_Items"
2.2 Add Attributes,"Primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, constraints","Include created_at, updated_at, soft deletes, audit fields"
2.3 Establish Relationships,"One-to-many, many-to-many relationships","Foreign key constraints, cascade rules, junction tables"
2.4 Create Schema,SQL DDL scripts with migrations,"Use Alembic for database migrations, seed data scripts"
3. Implement Backend APIs,Flask-RESTful with JSON responses,RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes
3.1 Create Product Endpoints,"GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /api/products","CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete products"
3.2 Create Order Endpoints,"GET, POST, PUT /api/orders",Order lifecycle: Draft → Pending → Processing → Completed
3.3 Implement Invoice Generation,POST /api/invoices with PDF generation,Automatic invoice creation on order completion
3.4 Add Authentication Endpoints,"POST /api/auth/login, /api/auth/register","Secure password hashing, JWT tokens, rate limiting"
4. Setup Authentication,Flask-JWT-Extended for token management,Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
4.1 Define Roles,Admin (manage all) vs User (own data only),"Admin: full access, User: limited to own data"
4.2 Implement JWT Login,JWT tokens with refresh mechanism,Access tokens (short-lived) + refresh tokens (long-lived)
4.3 Restrict API Access,@jwt_required decorator on protected routes,Middleware to check JWT validity and user roles
5. Build Frontend,React with modern hooks and context,Component-based architecture with reusable components
5.1 Create Auth Screens,Login/Register forms with validation,"Form validation, error states, loading indicators"
5.2 Create Product Dashboard,"Product listing, search, pagination","Search, filter, sort, pagination for large datasets"
5.3 Build Order Form,Multi-step order placement with cart,"Shopping cart, quantity selection, order summary"
5.4 Display Invoices,Invoice list with PDF download,"Invoice status tracking, download links, email sending"
5.5 Create Admin Panel,Admin-only sections with role checking,"Admin dashboard with user management, analytics"
6. Connect Frontend & Backend,Axios for HTTP requests,"Error handling, loading states, optimistic updates"
6.1 Use Axios/Fetch,React hooks for API integration,"API abstraction layer, request/response interceptors"
6.2 Test Data Flow,End-to-end workflow testing,Manual testing + automated tests for critical paths
6.3 Error Handling,Try-catch blocks and user feedback,"Toast notifications, error boundaries, retry logic"
7. Automate Invoice Generation,Background task or immediate generation,Event-driven architecture for invoice generation
7.1 Generate Invoice Details,Order completion triggers invoice creation,Order status change triggers invoice creation
7.2 Save to Database,Database record with unique invoice number,"Unique invoice numbers, tax calculations, discounts"
7.3 PDF Download Option,ReportLab or WeasyPrint for PDF,"PDF templates with company branding, email delivery"
8. Add Analytics Dashboard,React dashboard with Chart.js/Recharts,Interactive charts with drill-down capabilities
8.1 Show Sales Metrics,"Sales, inventory, top products metrics","Real-time metrics updating, export functionality"
8.2 Visualize with Charts,"Line charts, bar charts, pie charts",Chart.js or Recharts for responsive visualizations
9. Add Persistence,PostgreSQL with connection pooling,"Connection pooling, read replicas for scaling"
9.1 Store in Database,Database transactions and ACID compliance,"Atomic transactions, data integrity constraints"
9.2 Automatic Updates,Real-time stock updates on order placement,"Event sourcing for inventory changes, audit trail"
9.3 Database Triggers,Database triggers for inventory updates,Database-level triggers for automatic stock updates
10. Test System,Comprehensive testing strategy,"Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests"
10.1 Verify Authentication,Unit tests for login and role verification,"Authentication flow testing, session management"
10.2 Test Order Flow,Integration tests for complete workflows,Complete user journeys from login to invoice
10.3 Generate Invoices,PDF generation and download testing,"PDF generation testing, file download verification"
10.4 Multi-user Testing,Load testing with multiple concurrent users,"Concurrent user simulation, performance benchmarks"
11. Deploy Application,Cloud deployment strategy,Production-ready deployment with monitoring
11.1 Deploy Backend,Render/Heroku for Flask API,"Environment-specific configurations, health checks"
11.2 Deploy Frontend,Netlify/Vercel for React frontend,"Static asset optimization, CDN integration"
11.3 Connect Services,Environment variables and CORS setup,"API documentation, monitoring, error tracking"
12. Finalize & Showcase,Documentation and presentation,Professional presentation materials
12.1 Prepare Screenshots,Application screenshots and demo video,"UI/UX screenshots, feature highlights"
12.2 Upload to GitHub,Source code with proper README,"Clean code, comprehensive documentation"
